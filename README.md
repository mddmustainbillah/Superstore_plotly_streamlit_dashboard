# Exploratory Data Analysis on Sales Data Using Streamlit and Plotly

This project conducts an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sales data utilizing Streamlit and Plotly, two powerful Python libraries for interactive data visualization. The primary focus is on analyzing the sales data across different regions, states, and cities, offering insightful visual representations through various graphs and charts including bar graphs, tree maps, pie charts, and time series plots.

## Overview

In this project, we leverage Python's pandas library to extract and preprocess the sales data. The processed data is then utilized to generate interactive visualizations using Plotly, allowing users to dynamically explore and understand the sales trends and patterns across different regions, states, and cities.
